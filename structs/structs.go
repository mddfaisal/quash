type SubscriptionID string

// BUG FIX: this used to be `map[Topic]map[SubscriptionID]chan string`,
// i.e. a live reference into the server's internal broker map. That's
// unsafe for two independent reasons:
//  1. Go channels aren't JSON-marshalable, so json.Marshal on this field
//     would silently fail (the error was being discarded with `_`).
//  2. It exposed the live map with no lock protection to whoever held
//     this struct, which is what caused the "concurrent map iteration
//     and map write" panic in the admin dashboard.
//
// It's now a plain, already-safe snapshot: topic name -> subscriber count.
